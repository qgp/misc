# Tools and notes for OS installation

This repository contains a somewhat random selection of scripts and notes
for the installation/maintenance of various OSes.

## OS bootstrapping

Call the generic user script:
```bash
/bin/bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgp/os-utils/master/bootstrap.sh)
```
or from redirection:
```
/bin/bash <(curl -fsSL https://www.qgp.io/bootstrap_os.php)
```
